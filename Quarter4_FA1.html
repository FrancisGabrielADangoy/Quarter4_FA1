        <p>Help Bring Clean Water to communities in need!</p>

        <h2>Why Support Charity:Water?</h2>
        <p>According to the UN clean water is a basic human right everyone is entitled to. However, millions people around the world do not have access to it. Here are some reasons why you should support us:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Saves Lives: Nearly 703 million people in the world live without clean water. Everyday, nearly 1,000 children die from diseases caused by unsafe and unclean water. Your support can help us build wells, filtering stations, and piping systems providng clean and safe drinking water. </li>
            <li>Empowers Communities and Fosters Education: When there is a clean water supply, women and children do not have to worry anymore about collecting water in far rivers or far water sources. This in turn can help them pursue their education and other oppurtunities.</li>
            <li>100% Model: 100% of all donations raised go directly to fund the projects. Donors receive proof of every project that they helped fund through receipts, photos, and GPS coordinates.</li>
